// Create a class ArrayWrapper that accepts an array of integers in its constructor. This class should have two features:
// When two instances of this class are added together with the + operator, the resulting value is the sum of all the elements in both arrays.
// When the String() function is called on the instance, it will return a comma separated string surrounded by brackets. For example, [1,2,3].

export class ArrayWrapper {
    constructor(arr) {
        this.arr = arr;

    valueOf() {
        return this.arr.reduce((acc, el) => acc + el, 0);
    }

    toString() {
        return `[${this.arr.join(',')}]`
